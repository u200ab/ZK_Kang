Optimise your environment and refine it with a Distraction sheet

Turn your environment into a powerful focus zone.

1. Write down a list of things that distract you. They could be physical things, digital distractions, or even people.
2. Write down a list of changes you could make to your environment to remove the distractions or deter/inform people to help you focus.
3. Make the changes to your environment as best you can.
4. Next time you have a focused session, note any distractions on your distractions sheet.
5. Adjust your environment again based on your distractions sheet.

Repeat this process for at leastÂ **three sessions**. By this point, you should have made some high-yield changes to take control of your focus.

**Remember to share your experience and get ideas for how you can optimise your environment in our supportive and helpful community!**

**Tip:**

To take this to another level, attempt to use MVGs next time you feel like procrastinating and write down any barriers you encounter on your distractions sheet. For example, maybe you didn't have all the right tabs open, which caused you to feel like procrastinating.

This way, you can continue refining your environment with positive influences to make your path to focus as frictionless as possible while removing the negative distractors!
