# Dissect the Goal
- What **knowledge**, **attributes**, **skills**, **processes**, or **resources** do I need to achieve this goal?
Think about:

1. Mental health
2. Focus and concentration
3. Time management and prioritization skills
4. Studying skills

- **Ask yourself, "How sure am I?"**
- **This is an opportunity to identify if you truly know what is needed to achieve a goal, or if your ideas are based on unreliable sources or assumptions.**
# Evaluate your target level
- For each factor you identified in step 2, **rate** (out of 10) what level you need to reach to achieve your goal. Then, describe what this rating means to you so that it is clear and explicit.

**For example:**

You may need 7/10 time management and 8/10 studying skills to reach your goal of scoring in the top 5% of your cohort at the end of the year. Then, describe what 7/10 time management and 8/10 studying skills mean to you.

# Evaluate your current level
- For each factor, **rate** (out of 10) your current level and justify your rating. We can often overestimate or underestimate our abilities, so justify your rating as objectively as possible.
# Identify the 1%
- How could you go from where you are now to becoming 1% closer to your target level.
# Tips
- Do not try to improve on more than 2 skills or attributes at the same time. This causes overload and will hinder your ability to improve.
- Marginal gains usually progress from **knowledge** to **actions** to **behaviours, habits,** and **positions**. 
    - In the early stages, you first need to acquire **knowledge** on what action you need to take to improve your skills, processes, or attributes. 
    - Next, you must take **action** to commence the process of improvement. 
    - Over time, your actions change your **behaviours and habits** or your **position**. Your position is how much control you have over achieving your goal. When you are in a better position, you can reduce risks more.

**When you review your marginal gains again in the future, you often only need to repeat these final two steps (Step 4: Evaluate your current level and Step 5: Identify the 1%) as the first three steps will be similar.**

# Key principle

At any point in the above steps, you may find that you do not know the answer. 

**For example:**

- You may not be sure what skills you need to achieve your goal during step 2
- You may not know how good you need to be in step 3
- You may not know how to begin improving some attributes or skills in step 5

When you're unsure, gaining more information is the most important marginal gain for you.

**You cannot take action before knowing what action to take. Identifying uncertainties and gaining more information is often the best first marginal gain for any difficult goal.**

# The uncertainty of marginal gains

Often, the early stages of progress (or "gain") are confusing because there are so many things that must be worked on. Over time, as we work on each part, one step at a time, it becomes easier and clearer to see what our next best step is. In the beginning, the best step is sometimes just to take a step at all!

**Therefore, since the focus is on a** _**marginal**_ **gain, you do not need a comprehensive list of every knowledge, attribute, skill, process or resource, but simply the ones that seem clearly necessary as the next step.**
