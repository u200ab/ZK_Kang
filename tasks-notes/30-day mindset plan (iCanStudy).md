1. Choose a skill or task that you know you are not very good at. 
2. Break down this task into smaller and smaller steps or components until you feel that the chance of error for each individual step is very low. If you can't break down the task in this way, choose a different task!
3. Experiment with doing more of these steps in a single go and observe how it affects your chance of making an error. At what point do errors occur? Is it earlier or later than you expected?
4. Reflect on the consequence of those errors. Are they smaller or greater than you expected?
5. If you felt this was easy, choose another skill where the risk of error feels more significant and repeat from step 2.
