# Rapid Start Modules
## Rapid Time Management
- Task Management =/ Time Management
	- Both need to be good and sustainable
- Urgency VS Importance
	- Urgency: Current tasks like homework, tests etc. that brings in superficial benefits but mostly no personal growth/improvements on current methods of learning
	- Importance: Things that improves our quality of life, learning new skills
	- URGENCY TRAPPING: When urgent tasks take up most our attention than those tasks which are of heavy importance to improve our life
- Getting over Urgency Trapping
	- Theory / Practice time: Spending a 1:5 ratio to learn stuffs
	- Put tasks according to importance over than urgency
## Rapid Google Calendar Tutorial
- Add 30 minutes to every anticipated time to complete a task
- Have specific purposes, motivation towards a task (tldr , be specific)
## Rapid Procrastination Tips
- Tip 1: Make a list of tasks (to prevent being overwhelmed)
- Tip 2: Eliminate distractions in your environment, e.x. : Close distracting windows, put textbooks on the table, mute your phone’s notification
- Tip 3: Recognize homework before the day you do it (motivating you to do the work)
- Tip 4: Aim for effort (personal best) instead of perfection
- Tip 5: Group up with friends (peer pressure)
## Procrastination: Intermediate
- Don’t use motivation to fund your productivity
- Motivation is fluctuating and multifactorial, but everyone depends on it
### Habits: 
- Therefore, it is pivotal to build a system when you aren’t motivated (ex. being autopilot) and build habits

## Procrastination: Intermediate II – BEDS-M
- B (Burn ship strategy), from Sun Tze, the art of war: Intensify the consequences of failure
	- Prevents the mind’s tendency of catering to short term gains
- E (Environment): Remove all distraction in your environment
	- Ex. Blocking YouTube recommendations to avoid being pulled in to procrastination, being in a ‘‘boring’’ environment, where you have only two options: Study or nothing.
- D (Distraction/cheat sheet)
	- List down all the distractions
- S (Schedule)
	- [[Rapid Start Modules#Rapid Time Management|Refer to the Rapid time management module and the right way to schedule google calendar]]
- M (Minimum Viable Goals)
	- Minimize your goals (ex. Instead of doing a chapter, do a subchapter) 
	- Turning ‘‘Starting’’ to a habit ([[Rapid Start Modules#Habits]])
	- Checklist: [[BEDS-M-Checklist.pdf]]
## Increasing the success rate (3 common Errors) 
### Accessing the growth zone
#### 1. Comfort zone 
#### 2. Fear zone (where you’re uncertain, self-doubting) 
- Misinterpreted hypothesis: where a student believes the effort they put in isn’t worth it
- Fixed Mindset (repeat challenges, more on the outcome, adverse to failure)
- Growth mindset 
	- Accepts mistake, wondering the “why” on that outcome, “what-if”, give it a go —>make mistakes–>accept feedbacks.
#### 3. Growth zone (Challenging your own ideas, everything you believe and accepting its wrong)
- [[Rapid Start Modules#2. Fear zone (where you’re uncertain, self-doubting)|Fixed Mindset]]–>[[Rapid Start Modules#3. Growth zone (Challenging your own ideas, everything you believe and accepting its wrong)|Growth Zone]] : Dedicate Practice Blocks
	- After the practice, strongly reflect on the mistakes made on the practice block. 
- After applying a technique, fare it with other techniques so that the whole system runs well
## The consequences of rushing
- Rushing
	- Insufficient Practice
	- Insufficient Time
- After learning a new technique, make sure to associate to other techniques
## Selective Learning
- Component techniques are the basic structures of composite techniques, which will be more complex as the time go on, therefore **do not ignore anything**
- 1. **Do not rush.** Solid foundations create rapid progress. If we knew a faster way to get good, we’d tell you.
1. **Do not learn selectively.** If you’ve never heard of or used a technique before, it doesn’t mean you should skip it. Many techniques in the early stages are required to succeed in the later stages. Please learn and practice the full range of techniques, unless we advise you otherwise!
2. **Embrace mistakes**. You absolutely cannot improve your actual skills without practising and making mistakes. Accept and embrace this process
