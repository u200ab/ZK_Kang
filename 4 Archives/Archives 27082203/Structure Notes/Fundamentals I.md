## Spacing
- Revise on the same day you learned it (and then repeat every week and eventually months)
- A rule of thumb you can follow is to wait long enough until you feel like you are **just starting** to forget the material.
## Interleaving
- Seeing information in every degree possible (e.x. Watching a character in a movie and seeing how they react in a certain situation, (more practical) wondering an equation in math and how is it derived, the other ways it could be derived etc. )
- Unlimited interleaving techniques, therefore be competent on 3-4
- Chosen interleaving methods to experiment on
	- [[Plans in Studying]]
## Retrieval (Spaced, Interleaved retrieval)
- 1. Don’t look at notes beforehand, instead rely on your memory and use interleave techniques (ex mind mapping, teaching an imaginary student etc.), then check the notes.
- 2. ALWAYS RETRIEVE, and treat it as you would in an exam. (to identify subtle weaknesses)
