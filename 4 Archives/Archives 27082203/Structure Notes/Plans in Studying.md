# Learning through textbooks
-  1. Use ChatGPT to provide a basic summary of the topic 
-  2. Read the book and topics presented, and trying to associate it with my current knowledge 
-  3. Wondering the significance of concepts presented in the book (inquiry-based learning) 
-  4. Using generative questions ( that is, creating relational questions among concepts and prioritizing which relationship is important/most interesting )
-  5. Variable Addition (Adding logical/interesting variables from other chapters/book ) from concepts at other chapters 
-  6. using spacing after a chapter (depends on how dense the material is, desirable period is an hour)
-  7. After spacing, use Chunkmaps before reviewing the note as to see flaws in my depth of knowledge ()
- 8. Reviewing sections where I am weak at
- 9. No idea, will write later

# Time Management

- Use the time from 5:10 amâ€”6:30 am retrieving textbook information from the previous day (for the upcoming lessons) before reading my textbook to do studying. 
- Reviewing, listing homework for the day on a list and preferably completing homework and preparing for the next lessons by mind mapping content from my early morning study sessions 
- using flashcards / reading books of interest/ just resting/ check WhatsApp when commuting 
- after just getting back home, take a [power nap](https://www.wikihow.com/Power-Nap) for 20 minutes, whilst resisting the temptation to sleep longer after the 20 minute mark
