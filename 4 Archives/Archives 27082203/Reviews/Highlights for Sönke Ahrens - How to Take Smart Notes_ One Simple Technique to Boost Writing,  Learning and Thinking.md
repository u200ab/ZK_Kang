- We are still soused to the idea that a great outcome requires great effort that we tend not tobelieve that a simple change in our work routines could not only make usmore productive, but the work also more fun.
- How to be more productive:
	- better to keep your options open during the writing process rather than limit yourself to your first idea
	- result of smart working environments that avoid resistance in the first place 
	- Having the right mindse + right workflow.
- Writing is, without dispute, the best facilitator for thinking, reading, learning, understanding and generating ideas we have
	- If you want to really understand something, you have to translate it into your own words
	- By writing, students demonstrate what they havelearned and show their ability to think critically and develop ideas.

- fleeting notes.
	- capture every idea that pops into your mind
	- Forgetting what you meant —>Notes are not organized
- literature notes
	- Write down what you don’t want to forget or think you mightuse in your own thinking or writing
- Permanent notes 
	- contains the necessary information in a permanently understandable way. 

- General maxims:
	- Just follow your interest and always take the path that promises the most in sight.
	- Don’t wait until you have everything together. Rather, try ideas out and give yourself enough time to go back to reading and note-taking to improve your ideas, arguments, and their structure.
	- Truth does not belong to anyone; it is the outcome of the scientific exchange of written ideas
	- the presentation and the production of knowledge cannot be separated, but are rather two sides of the same coin
- General signs of success:
	- Slip-box becomes more and more valuable the more it grows, instead of getting messy and confusing. 
	- The first system is designed to find things you deliberately search for , putting all the responsibility on your brain. 
	- Designed to present you with ideas you have already forgotten, allowing your brain to focus on thinking instead of remembering.
- Crucial factors of success
	- Critical mass, 
- 1. Fleeting notes, which are only reminders of information, can be written in any kind of way and will end up in the trash within a day or two.2. Permanent notes, which will never be thrown away and contain the necessary information in a permanently understandable way. They are always stored in the same way in the same place, either as literature notes in the reference system or written as if for print, in the slip-box.3. Project notes, which are only relevant to one particular project. They are kept within a project-specific folder and can be discarded or archived after the project is finished.
- Typical mistakes:
	- Keeping a scientific journal (Basically noting everything down tentatively)
		- Pros: No idea ever gets lost
		- Cons:
			- It wilnever build up to a critical mass (as everything is permanent)
			- Good ideas are diluted to insignificance by all the other notes, 
	- Collect notes only related to specific projects. 
	- treat all notes as fleeting notes
- important to reflect on the purpose of these different types ofnotes.
- But before he stored them away,he would read what he noted down during the day, think about its relevancefor his own lines of thought and write about it
- permanent notes. 
- Project-related notes can be: 
	- comments in the manuscript
	- collections of project-related literature
	- outlines
	- snippets of drafts
	- reminders
	- to-do lists
	- draft 
- When you close the folder for your current project in the evening and nothing is left on your desk other than pen and paper, you know that you have achieved a clear separation between fleeting, permanent and project-related notes.
