# Marginal Gains

This should be completed at least **once per week**, and ideally at the end of every day, with
each day bringing a new 1% gain.

## 1. Anchor Your Goals (Monthly)
- What is your goal? (Recommended between 9 to 36 months) : Adopting Chinese as a way of thought ,being fluent in it and actually welling up new ideas (that is, I can express my thoughts in Chinese vividly)
## 2. Dissect the Goal (Monthly)
- What do you need to be good at to achieve this goal? 
	- DECLARATIVE KNOWLEDGE : Going through my textbook and doing the test questions + actually picking up a few dialogue i find interesting and inquire my teacher about it, then plugging it in flashcards / Zettelkasten system
	- PROCEDURAL KNOWLEDGE: (Kinda) Speaking + Writing + Thinking: Writing essays using the ideas I’d amassed in my zettelkasten system, pronunciation it out loud and see how can I interleave it. then submitting for feedback whilst enjoying my work.
	- PERIODIC LANGUAGE IMMERSION: 1. Switching one ideas at a time in my zettelkasten system to Chinese (and if I don’t know one I’ll leave it to the side and plug it into flashcards) 2. Switching all my English content into chinese and catch the essential Ideas + elegant words in it. 
- Be as specific as possible.
- Focus on processes, not outcomes. Processes lead to outcomes and are controllable. Outcomes are symptoms of the process, and we cannot directly control it. Include goals about mental health, focus and concentration, time management and procrastination, study skills and how much you can retain given the time spent studying.
- Marginal Benefits to think about
	- Mental Health
	- Focus and Concentration
	- Time management and Procrastination
	- Studying skills and how efficiently you are using your time
- Marginal Benefits
	- Timetables (Time/Task Management System): Prioritize tasks that provide more self-growth in the future instead of temporary tasks
	- Procrastination: “Just do it” as a motto , do not stress and do not fret
	- Time Efficiency: Doing HW during recess time + pre-study notes.
	- Focus : Put all my homework away except the tasks in front of me, and doing it while doing BEDS-M
## 3. Evaluate Your Level (Weekly)
- How good am I at this right now?
	- I struggle at writing expositions (due to the lack of ideas and a goal motivation, not language-oriented)
	- I am decently good at extracting meaning from passages of Classical Chinese.
	- I struggle to articulate my thoughts when I speak.
	- other real life tasks block me from practicing Chinese
- How do I know I am this good?
- What condition must be true for my evaluation of my level to be accurate?
- What is everything I do with regards to this process? (Think of this step like an instruction manual for someone else to do exactly what you do - be as specific as possible)
- Is it possible that I am not as good as I think I am?
- If yes, what do I need to learn more about to be certain of my level?
## 4. Find the 1% (How can you be 1% better)? (Weekly)
- Any amount of improvement is acceptable, even if it isn’t technically 1%.
- Consider improvements relating to consistency, speed, being intentional, reflecting more
regularly or more critically, and especially learning more about what you need to do and
experimenting with new methods.
## 5. Reflection (Daily) 
- How did your experiment go? Did you get better? 
	- If not, why – and how can you change that?
	- If yes– what made it easier or harder for you to succeed?
