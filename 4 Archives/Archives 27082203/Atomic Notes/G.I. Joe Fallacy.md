# G.I. Joe Fallacy

TARGET DECK: General

START
Basic (and reversed card)
What is the G.I. Joe Fallacy? How do you combat it?
Back: The mistaken idea that knowing is half the battle. Merely knowing something or our biases is not enough to change behavior. To change behavior, you have to change habits as well.

The name is from the 1980s cartoon which ended each episode with the PSA, “Now you know. And knowing is half the battle…” The PSA focused on something dangerous that kids did unintentionally — like running out into traffic.
