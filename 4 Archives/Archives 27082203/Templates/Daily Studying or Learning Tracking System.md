# Learning System

## 1. What do you want to Prestudy on?
- Today?
- This Week?
## 2. What do you want to revise on?
- Today?
- This week? 
## 3. Evaluate Your Level (Weekly)
- How good am I at this right now?
- How do I know I am this good?
- What condition must be true for my evaluation of my level to be accurate?
- What is everything I do with regards to this process? (Think of this step like an instruction manual for someone else to do exactly what you do - be as specific as possible)
- Is it possible that I am not as good as I think I am?
- If yes, what do I need to learn more about to be certain of my level?
## 4. Find the 1% (How can you be 1% better)? (Weekly)
- Any amount of improvement is acceptable, even if it isn’t technically 1%.
- Consider improvements relating to consistency, speed, being intentional, reflecting more
regularly or more critically, and especially learning more about what you need to do and
experimenting with new methods.
## 5. Reflection (Daily)
- How did your experiment go? Did you get better? 
	- If not, why – and how can you change that?
	- If yes– what made it easier or harder for you to succeed?
