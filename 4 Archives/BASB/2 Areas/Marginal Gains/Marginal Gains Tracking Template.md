# Marginal Gains
This should be completed at least **once per week**, and ideally at the end of every day, with
each day bringing a new 1% gain.
## 1. Anchor Your Goals (Monthly)
- What is your goal? (Recommended between 9 to 36 months)
- Here we are trying to find a goal that is not too short-term and not very far. We can actually make this goal using the SMART criteria:

- S(Specific):Have a very specific goal that you want to reach. Usually making a specific goal will already have the other criteria checked, but it’s always to look if it’s follow the pattern or not  
- M(Measurable): Have a quality or quantity indicator on how big or how good you want to reach  
- A(Attainable): This is just saying “be realistic”. Look at your own condition and see, with your current skills and talents, could you reach that goal in a maximum less than 3 years away?  
- R(Relevant): This is a criteria which just means having the goal to be meaningful to you  
- T(Time-bound): Set some deadline on how long you want to work on this goal. Remember, it must be around 9 months away and less than 3 years away.

## 2. Dissect the Goal (Monthly)
- What do you need to be good at to achieve this goal?

- Be as specific as possible.

- Make sure to think about:
	1. Mental health
	2. Focus and concentration
	3. Time management and procrastination
	4. Studying skill and how efficiently you use your time
	5. Environmental Optimizations, Limiting Habits and scripted actions

- **Focus on processes, not outcomes.** Processes lead to outcomes and are controllable. Outcomes are symptoms of the process, and we cannot directly control it. 

- How do you identify a process? 

	- A process is a compilation of actions or behaviours that you do in order to reach the goal. Here you should try to think of all the actions or behaviours that would help you lead to your goal. 
	- A good question to start is **“what are the things that I need to have and do to reach this goal?”** This will create a list of the actions and the behaviours that you need to do to reach that goal. 
	- From the list you have just created, identify **3 or 4 actions** or behaviours that you think will yield the best result if focused on from now on. This will be your current processes.

- Examples Goal: Get at least 90 in biology final exam in 2 months
	- Processes
		- Revise Materials  
		- Create study schedule 
		- Study in a conducive environment  
		- Get better sleep quality
		- Study effectively using SIR
	- How can these processes help us reach our goal? (Performance Goals)
		- Revise material: by revising the material, I would retain the knowledge more and I would forget less 
		- Create study schedule: By creating a study schedule, I can slowly study subjects one by one so I don’t get overload at the end and being in a state of panic when the exam date is near
		- Study in a conducive environment: With creating a conducive environment for studying, I would be able to fully focus and not get distracted by anyone or anything
		- Get better sleep quality: Having a good night sleep would help me with my memory, and help me to not feel tired or sluggish throughout the day so I can do more
		- Study effectively: I need to study with the correct process for SIR that will make me understand it fully logically
  

## 3. Evaluate Your Level (Weekly)
- How good (What level) am I at this right now?
	- This is mostly self explanatory, however be careful! **It’s best to make this measurable, for example a 1-5 star self rating.** 
	- Since rating yourself is subjective it’s usually a good idea to ask yourself **“Is there a possibility that I’m on [Mt Stupid](https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/basics/dunning-kruger-effect#:~:text=The%20Dunning-Kruger%20effect%20is,accurately%20assessing%20their%20own%20skills.) right now?”**
	- ### Examples:
		- “I’m clearly a 5/5 at building rockets which go to Mars”
		-  “I think I’m a 1/5 at spaced interleaved retrieval, especially spacing”
- How do I know I am this good?
	- This question asks you to give reasoning for your evaluation, once again our aim here is to make sure that we’re not on Mt Stupid!
	- This question essentially acts as a check for your answer to “How do I know I am this good?” and forces you to rethink your initial evaluation. To answer this question properly, we have to create a set criteria for what defines our evaluation. Specificity is king, for this question  
	- ### Examples:
		-  “I know I’m a 5/5 at building rockets because I can build a paper plane which has a flight time of more than 5 seconds!”
		- “I know I’m 1/5 at spacing since I don’t follow my spacing schedule ever”
- What condition must be true for my evaluation of my level to be accurate?
	- This question essentially acts as a check for your answer to “How do I know I am this good?” and forces you to rethink your initial evaluation. 
	- To answer this question properly, we have to create a set criteria for what defines our evaluation. Specificity is king, for this question. 
	- Using the first example evaluation, our answer to this question would be WHAT makes someone a 5/5 in terms of building rockets.
	- There may sometimes also be instances where we have evaluated ourselves as being BAD at a certain process
	- In such instances, we follow the same process, but we want to be setting a metric for what makes a person bad at this process.  
	- Examples:
		-  “To be a top tier rocketeer, I must be able to easily calculate the thrust required by a rocket to be able to escape Earth’s atmosphere, alongside fly to Mars. I must also be able to invest 2 billion dollars out of my own pocket, as building a large scale rocket isn’t cheap. Lastly, I must be someone as capable as Harsh, Ravi, Pan, and Yinrozvel (They’re very cool).”
		- “To be bad at SIR, I must be someone that only uses the lower level interleaving techniques (Levels 0 and 1). Additionally, I must also be someone that uses my notes as a cue before I start my session. As the spacing aspect is not that crucial, and is only there to act as a way to create structure, to be bad at this means that I am not doing my SIR at all.”
- What is everything I do with regards to this process? (Think of this step like an instruction manual for someone else to do exactly what you do - be as specific as possible)
	- The aim for this question is to help you understand your processes, what steps do you take in what order? This gives us good data to work with and places to find the 1% improvements.
	- Examples:
		- “Before I build a rocket, I research what parts are available to me and build a structure to hold all the parts. I did this by splitting the airframe into 3 parts…”
		-  “I have scheduled one weekly and one monthly SIR session, however when I am prompted to do a SIR session I don’t know what I should be retrieving and interleaving. I end up waiting a week before my exam and cram everything. I do this by reading and writing my notes over and over again. I do this 4 times and I write them up into flash cards to act as memory aids. Then I don’t sleep on the night of the exam so I can memorize my flash cards.”
- Is it possible that I am not as good as I think I am?
	- This is where question 2 (your own opinions on how good you are) and question 3 (an objective metric for one to be good/achieved their goal) comes into play. For example, If you were doing ICS, how would you know if your mindmaps are good? If you were taking a test, how would you know you did well? If you were playing basketball, how would you know your form is good?
	- The answer is - comparing your performance with an objective metric; our answers to questions 2 and 3 serve both requirements respectively. In this question, you will go through your answer to “How do I know I am at this level” and compare It to your answer to “What conditions must be true for my evaluation to be correct”. If there is any discrepancy between the two answers, we can be assured that our evaluation might have actually been incorrect.  

- If yes, what do I need to learn more about to be certain of my level?
	- We only answer this question If we came to the conclusion that our evaluation was incorrect, from question 5. The answer to this question is very straightforward. We want to figure where we stand at the things we have listed in our answer to question 3. The examples will illustrate this point better
	- Examples:
		- We have listed in our answer to Question 3 that a top tier rocketeer must be able to:
			1) Calculate thrust required by a rocket in order to exit Earth’s atmosphere and head to Mars easily 
			2) Have 2 billion dollars of expendable cash 3) Be as capable as Harsh.
			- To be sure of our level, we have to figure out our proficiency with all those points. 
				- How good are we at calculating rocket trajectory? How much money do we have? 
				- How capable are we in this field? 
				- This will be our answer, and then once we figure It out, we will redo the entire evaluation
## 4. Find the 1% (How can you be 1% better)? (Weekly)
- Any amount of improvement is acceptable, even if it isn’t technically 1%.
- Consider improvements relating to consistency, speed, being intentional, reflecting more regularly or more critically, and especially learning more about what you need to do and experimenting with new methods.
	- **

- Being more consistent
	- This just can be about the accuracy or the frequency! For example: “Every time I have a scheduled session for SIR, I will make sure to do the minimum viable goal or I’ll burn my boats” (Frequency)  
	- “Whilst I’m doing a SIR session, I will make sure to close any notes I have and put books away, this ensures I will be forced to do true recall which is more effective” (Accuracy)
    
- Taking less time
	- Be careful with this one, ACCURACY > speed always. However if you’re wasting time due to being distracted then aim to fix that ASAP (BEDS-M), you’ll save time and be more focused, which results in compounding marginal gains! Alternatively, if you notice that you’re wasting time due to a step which can be integrated elsewhere, you can save time here!  
		- Example: “I will put my phone in my wardrobe and put it on silent, then I will set a timer on my laptop for 20 mins so I can fully focus on doing my SIR session for teaching/practice questions/any other interleaving technique”  
		- “To save time, I will start integrating scheduling into my night routine!”
    
- Being more intentional
	- Just another way of saying “being focused”. If you know EXACTLY what to do and set the intention on doing it this way, success is inevitable and any ‘failures’ will result in exponential growth. Essentially experiment with specific ways, you’re (technically) a learning scientist after all.  
		- Example: “I will write a post-it note so that I remember to teach whilst doing a mind map brain dump using true recall, this is so that I can have more interleaving and cognitive load”
    
- Reflecting more regularly or critically
	- It’s always a good idea to ask yourself “Did this help me, why is it helping me/not helping me? What can I do to improve it?”
- Learning more about a skill or a technique
	- As part of ICS, you have a huge [interleaving table](https://icanstudy.com/interleaving-table/) right at your fingertips to use! Ask coaches or the community about anything you’re stuck with and give it a go.
- Experimenting with a new way of doing things in a small way
	- Key word, small. Don’t overwhelm yourself! Make a small change, make sure it’s marginal and give it a go. 
		- Example: “Since I tend to get distracted easily, even with a pomodoro timer, I will set a loud alarm every 10 mins to bring me back into the focus state.”

- The final two points, learning and experimenting are typically the most powerful gains you can have because they compound the most easily.
- You may not think that “learning more” is a gain, since there isn’t always an instant outcome that tells you that you got better, but this is **often** what is needed when you are **unsure** about how to improve
- If you think about **progress**, someone who has tried and failed is one step closer to their goal than someone who has not tried. And someone who knows what to try is a step closer than someone who doesn’t even know!
## 5. Reflection (Daily)
- How did your experiment go? Did you get better? 
	- If not, why – and how can you change that?
	- If yes– what made it easier or harder for you to succeed?

# things to be cautious about during experiments

1. Efficacy - Don’t worry about the effectiveness of the experiment. We don’t care whether our experiment works out (ie - improves our situation) or not; this is because regardless, we will reflect on them and figure out what made our experiment fail/succeed. 
	- It is usual, even EXPECTED, that your initial experiments will not yield major benefits. This is because this sort of experimentation is not something everyone’s used to, especially in regards to specific processes. As you keep doing them, the quality of your experiments will increase, as you will have more data on who you are.
    
2. Specificity - We want our experiments AS SPECIFIC AS POSSIBLE. This makes them actionable, and also makes it more likely that we will do it. When creating your experiments, be sure to analyse whether it’s as specific as it can be.  
      
    - For example, using our “Cold Email Elon Musk For 600 Million $ in funding” example, It’s much more specific than “Email Rich People For Funding”. We’ve specified who we’re going to email, and how much we’re going to ask. This reduces decision-fatigue for us in the moment, where we just have to execute. 
    
3. Choosing Processes - Remember our evaluation step (the one where we set up specific criterions for achieving the goal)? This is where they come in handy the most. At the end of every week, we want to be re-doing this evaluation step. 
	- After this is done, we will pick **TWO of our weakest processes** (ie the one we rated the lowest). For our first week, we just pick two of our weakest processes from the initial evaluation. By picking a maximum of two processes per week, we can stop ourselves from getting overwhelmed
