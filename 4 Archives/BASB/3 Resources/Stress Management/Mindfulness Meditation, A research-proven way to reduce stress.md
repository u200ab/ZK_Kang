## What is Mindfulness Meditation? 
- Mindfulness meditation changes our brain and biology in positive ways, improving mental and physical health.
- But a simple way to think of it (Mindfulness Meditation) is [training your attention](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2006-03947-004) to achieve a mental state of calm concentration and positive emotions.
- It has two main parts: attention and acceptance.
	- The **attention** piece is about tuning into your experiences to focus on what's happening in the present moment. It typically involves directing your awareness to your breath, your thoughts, the physical sensations in your body and the feelings you are experiencing.
	- The **acceptance** piece involves observing those feelings and sensations without judgment. **Instead of responding or reacting to those thoughts or feelings, you aim to note them and let them go.
- Such programs (Mindfulness Classes) might include breathing exercises, yoga and guided lessons to help you become aware of your body sensations, thoughts and feelings.
##  Why/How Mindfulness works? 
- The benefits of mindfulness are related to its ability to dial down the body's response to stress.
- Psychological scientists have found that mindfulness influences [two different stress pathways in the brain](https://journals.lww.com/psychosomaticmedicine/Abstract/2019/04000/Mindfulness_Training_and_Physical_Health_.2.aspx), changing brain structures and activity in regions associated with [attention and emotion regulation](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrn3916).

## Effects
- Psychology researchers found strong evidence that people who received MBCT were less [likely to react with negative thoughts or unhelpful emotional reactions in times of stress](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272735815000197).
- People who participated in MBCT or MBSR were better able to focus on the present and less likely to worry and to think about a negative thought or experience over and over.
- What's more, mindfulness-based interventions can [improve physical health](https://journals.lww.com/psychosomaticmedicine/Abstract/2019/04000/Mindfulness_Training_and_Physical_Health_.2.aspx), too.
