# Marginal Gains
This should be completed at least **once per week**, and ideally at the end of every day, with
each day bringing a new 1% gain.
## 1. Anchor Your Goals (Monthly)
- I want to score all A+ in SPM by 2025 (the year I'm taking SPM). 
## 2. Dissect the Goal (Monthly)
- Focusing and understanding what I will be tested on: By understanding and focusing what I will be tested on, I will not stray to other non-relevant educational materials. 
- Follow studying skills taught in iCS course consistently: By doing SIR, prestudy, non-linear note taking and kolbs consistently, I will be able to further enhance my studying system by retaining more information and being more reflective about my processes
- Increase focus during a session by reducing procrastination: Creating a schedule according to the Eisenhower matrix (according to importance instead of urgency) so I won't be hesitating about what to do every time and using BEDS-M so that I won't be procrastinating. 
## 3. Evaluate Your Level (Weekly)
- First Process: 6/10, Second Process: 6/10, Third Process: 4/10
## 4. Find the 1% (How can you be 1% better)? (Weekly)
- 
## 5. Reflection (Daily)
